In collaboration with @siddankthep 

This is a work-in-progress that is expected to be done by May 2024. This repository contains documents related to my learning Natural Language Processing. Ultimate goal of this project is to complete 2 tasks:
### Task 1 
Given a document (paragraph of text), generate questions relevant to the document. 

### Task 2 
Given a document (paragraph of text) and a questions whose answer can be found in the document, provide the answer to that question.
